## Environmental Data Analysis using PowerBI

### Project Description
The primary objective of this university project was to assess the environmental footprint of G20 nations by examining various sustainability metrics. The project aimed to use Power BI to create interactive visualizations that highlight the impacts and trends related to energy production, consumption, and environmental sustainability within these nations.

### Data Description
The data utilized for this project included comprehensive environmental statistics from G20 countries, adapted from various sources such as the World Bank. Key metrics included:
- CO2 and methane emissions (tons per capita),
- Energy use (kg per capita),
- Renewable vs. non-renewable energy consumption percentages,
- Specific environmental factors like land surface temperature, PM2.5 air pollution, and forest area percentages.
These datasets were meticulously selected and prepared to ensure relevance and reliability, focusing on current global environmental challenges.

### Tasks Performed
1. **Dataset Selection and Cleaning**: Initially, the team engaged in a rigorous process of dataset selection, focusing on the relevance and quality of data concerning current global environmental developments. This phase also involved structured data cleaning and preparation.
   
2. **Data Analysis**: Using Power BI, we performed an in-depth analysis which included scanning the dataset for correlations, detecting outliers, and adding necessary computations through DAX programming to enrich the dataset.
   
3. **Data Visualization**: The project heavily emphasized creating dynamic and interactive visualizations in Power BI. The visualizations were designed to be user-friendly, allowing users to explore various data dimensions such as time trends and comparisons between different countries and metrics.
   
4. **Insight Development and Reporting**: The visualizations helped synthesize complex data into actionable insights about the environmental performance of G20 countries, comparing factors like renewable energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and other pollution metrics. We prepared a detailed report, articulating the findings and implications of their analysis.

This project stands as a significant academic exercise in applying data visualization tools to real-world issues, enhancing understanding of global environmental sustainability through the lens of the major economies in the G20. The PowerBI report is attached to this repository as a PowerBI file and a pdf.
